# Project Proposal

Write a proposal for a software product you would like to pursue for the majority of the semester. Make it obvious, interesting, and make the need for it sound convincing.

## Collaboration

In future semesters, you should have a group activity for students to acquaint themselves. I don't know anyone in the class and there's no opportunity to get to know them either.

## What to include

Your proposal must focus on the product's value proposition, including answers to the questions below. Keep it thorough but concise. If you are not clear on whether your writing is any good, consult with a friend.

### Project title

Jabes

### What and why?

Jabes is a streaming service. There's a lack of streaming services available. Thus, offering a more favorable algorithm to users for a new dynamic content range solves the "content-locking" issue users face when searching for content similar to what they currently like but wish to branch out of.

### For whom?

Jabes will be for content creators and every-day internet users.

For content-creators, it'll offer a range of integratiblity and customizability from other platforms. Its primary highlight will be the ability to curate communities rapidly and efficiently.

For users, it'll offer better algorithms to recommend ranked feed content. These users can be friends, family, students, elderly, but will primarily be young adults or teenagers. 

This product will not be for Mac users initially as that requires the creation of a custom streaming software with Apple-certified kernel access which is a separate project in itself.

### How?

A description of what the system will do from an end-user's perspective. Be as complete as necessary to fully explain the system, but do not worry about technical implementation - this will be developed in subsequent work.

Jabes will allow guest users to view the application but guest users cannot create any content or engage with it such as following, liking, commenting, and more. Guests can choose to create accounts if they like the content to engage with it. Upon creation, users will get a randomly assorted list of content for their ranked feed, a trending feed, and a fresh content feed that tailors to content they have not approached before. 

Users can filter tags, content, or creators. They can also comment or like during streams or get notifications during them.

If a user is a creator, they can schedule streams and events. 

### Scope

A brief justification that the proposal is neither too easy nor too ambitions for a group of approximately 4 - 6 programmers to undertake in one semester.

Please note, for this project, security will be ignored for ease-of-creation.

The scope will be:
- User authentication
- Create user profiles
- Allowing users to stream
- Allow users to view streams
- Allow users to save streams
- Allow users to comment on streams
- Allow users to like streams

Stretch Goals: 
- Allow users to follow creators
- Allow users to add events
- Add ranked feed
- Add notifications


## Submission

Complete the assignment as a Markdown document in the file named `README.md` in this repository. The message should be nicely formatted and outlined with a clear heading and sub-headings for each section.

Use the `git` features of **Visual Studio Code** to commit your work and `push` them to the GitHub repository.

Share the link to your document in your private assignments Discord channel AND in the public #project-ideas channel. In both cases, include the title of your project for all to see in the message.

## What happens next

We will select a subset of the proposals that we think will be the most interesting and appropriate for this course. These will be published to the class. Your next assignment will be to rank your favorites. We will then make team assignments based on this information and the answers you have provided to the previous introductory questionnaire.

If your proposal is selected, you are 99% guaranteed to be part of that team.
